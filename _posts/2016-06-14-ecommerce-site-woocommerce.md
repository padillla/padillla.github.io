## Ecommerce website creation with WooCommerce from scratch


When I looked for options to create a basic online store for a client who requested me to update his catalog style site into a functional ecommerce website, I found a lot of good options that are functional and secure, prebuilt ecommerce solutions are making loads of money out of allowing you to focus only on placing your products to the public.
They manage everything that could be considered technical in the background and allow you to just think in your strategy and other stuff. Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento and others are good examples.
They also make use of that leverage by monetizing every single aspect of the store, so you pay more if your shop gets bigger.

It all makes sense unless you are a starter looking  from somewhere cheaper.
I will show you:
- Setup a Wordpress site for $5 a month.
- Setup WooCommerce.
- Configure multi-language.
- Load your Product Catalog.
- Setup a fine ass (and free) theme and customize it to your preferences.
- Connect a payment gateway


 You can decide later if you want to scale to one of those fancier options.
 
 
 #Wordpress Setup
 
 -Go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) login with your google account or make a dummy one, in my opinion sometimes is safer to use an email that knowbody but you know about,  if someone targets you for a hack, you it removes an attack vector. Or I'm just too paranoid.
 
 -Once you are there go to Cloud Launcher
 -Deploy an instance of bitnami
