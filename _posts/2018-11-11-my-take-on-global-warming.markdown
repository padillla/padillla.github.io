It's okay to doubt science, all body of it is built on centuries of doubts and questions.

I like healthy skepticism, but not the kind that is skeptic because it wants to be okay to fill the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like we ve been doing the last 200 years.

For all I know, people who deny human-made climate change are looking forward to keep the same pollution levels, because it keeps money flowing as usual with their outdated and unmodifiable interests.

Some of those who want to deny that fact, are not even in that benefited elite, they just lick some companies asses for one reason or another(stocks, job, career, things they can change if they really cared), or because some politician with same interest tell them that polluting is okay, because the planet warming to a dangerous levers is natural, so we can keep polluting as long as we want, because the left/progressives/jews/communists/globalists wants to profit from being a cleaner species. 

We are going to hell fellas. Because we are a fucking dirty, disgusting, self destructive species that ridicules positive changes in exchange for some quick cash.

If we let irrationality  take over,  we deserve to die off.
