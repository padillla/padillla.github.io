I have immersed in a world that bring new chances to make my imagination fly and make my ideas a real deal.

Back in 2014, I took a debt and about 6 weeks of work and lots of googling to get a Printrbot Simple up and running.
I tuned it, calibrated it and improved it.
So far I have:

* Replaced all wood parts of the machine with a metal chassis I got on ebay.

* Increased the X axis of the build volume from 99mm to 200 mm.

* Increased the Y axis of the build volume from 99mm to 200 mm.

* Increased Z Axis volume from 115mm to 270mm

* [Installed filament spool holder. With Z wobble stability bearing inside](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3241273)

* Installed Raspberry Pi and Octoprint to control and record printings without need of a PC.

* Changed Extruder nozzle from Ubis Ceramic to Ubis 13s which improved precision and lowered failed prints.

* Added 2 x 40mm blower fans.

* Installed motor dampeners and then removed them because they ruined the print quality.

* Installed a smaller servo in the extruder, to reduce weight. - Bad Idea has no strength to push filament

* Installed a heated bed.

* [Installed an amazing printing surface](https://www.filafarm.de/collections/druckbetten/products/druckplatte-fur-abs-und-pla)

* Replaced the 120w power supply for a 400w that can handle the heat bed

For me is an amazing learning tool. Some planned improvements for this machine are:

* Setup Raspi Camera for timelapses.

* Setup secure remote control and visualization.

* Replace nozzle tip for hardened one to handle abrasive materials.

* Print in Proto-Pasta Carbon Fibre.

* Add a Bowden extrusion system.

* Make it double extruder with another Bowden.

* Print and install  iamjonhlawrence double precision improvements to X and Y axis.

* [Install a silicon heater to the heatbed.

* Make an enclosure.

* Print in ABS and Nylon CF.

* Removable laser head.

* Removable milling head.

I have dealt with all kinds of issues with this machine, I love to resolve them and se it print at a better quality each time.
I have now the intention to transform a small printrbot in a better machine that allows me to fabricate and prototype better parts at a more efficient rate reducing errors.
I can now resolve any problem related to Cartesian FFF 3D printers and calibrate them. Ping me for help.

At some point I will immerse myself in 3D Design, once the horse is dominated.

There is also an [active community in Costa Rica ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/649106395172543/)where all learners of this stuff gather and worship noisy machines like me.

I will keep this page regularly updated as times allows it, feel free to visit me on other platforms where I upload or fing very cool things to make:

Of course I added this page so I can get those improvements become a reality quicker than my paycheck, so if you want a 3D print for your project, personal amusement, or charity, hit that button below and or ping me in [my contact page](%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/contact).
