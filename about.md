Hi, I'm **Rodolfo Padilla**. I'm a student at
[UNED](http://www.uned.ac.cr/) in the
[ECEN](http://www.uned.ac.cr/ecen/) department, where my studies
include, computer science, physics, and sociology.

I'm obsessed with robotics and space technology, and have engaged on the lifelong trek towards sustainable energy for those purposes.

Currently working as a tech support agent, fixing computers and such.

I like to be constanly learning, web development mainly these days. I believe I am at the state to make a living by doing it and turn some ideas into reality.

I can currently code in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I can survive in Spanish, English, and a bit of German.

This blog is a central place for me to publish my musings on programming, sociology, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy and all
sorts of other fascinating things. In the unlikely case that the Internet cares
about my personal development,  I also detail my quest to *live intentionally*
through  periodic reflections and goals posts.

I am also an electrician, I have vast experience fixing things, pretty much any device powered by electricity: 

* Computers
* Smartphones
* Home appliances 
* Industrial machinery and tools
