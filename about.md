<p class="message">
  A guy from Costa Rica, the most beautiful place on earth.

  Currently living in Cartago.
</p>
Working as a tech support agent, fixing computers and such.

I like to be constanly learning, web development mainly these days. I believe I am at the state to make a living by doing it and turn some ideas into reality. I also study more computer stuff at [UNED](http://www.uned.ac.cr/).

I can currently code in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
My skills in those areas are like the ones you can expect from someone who likes eating books in the matter, and hands dirty.

I try to keep my reading tracked on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/padillla).


Please have a look at my [Github](https://github.com/padillla) and laugh at my code if you find it laughable. Or hire me.
 
I am also an electrician, I have vast experience fixing things, pretty much any device powered by electricity: 

* Computers
* Smartphones
* Home appliances 
* Industrial machinery and tools

I am also into physics, solar energy and other alternative sources of energy.



# Thanks for reading!
