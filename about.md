Hi, I'm **Rodolfo Padilla**. I'm a student at
[UNED](http://www.uned.ac.cr/) in the
[ECEN](http://www.uned.ac.cr/ecen/) department, where my studies
include, computer science, sociology and other stuff.


Currently working as Implementation Engineer at [GAP](http://www.wearegap.com/).

I like to be constanly learning. Since I was 9 my passion is deconstruct and rebuild things from the ground. Usually leaving some screws out.

This blog is a central place for me to publish my ideas on programming, sociology, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy and all
sorts of other things I am interested in and cannot seriously publish elsewhere.
In the very unlikely case that the Internet cares about my personal development, I might post some progress in some personal projects I am working on.

Among many things I love doing, I try to make at least 60km on the bike every week, and plan to improve as long as time allows it.
Doing 3d printing and robotics as a hobby, 3D modeling is something I strive to do everyday better, as my cheap and modded printrbot allows it.
If ever try doing some sort of art or music again, I might post it. Be afraid.

I am also an electrician, I have experience doing industrial automation, robotics and I'm very efficient at changing lightbulbs.
