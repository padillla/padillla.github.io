Hi, I'm **Rodolfo Padilla**. I'm a student at
[UNED](http://www.uned.ac.cr/) in the
[ECEN](http://www.uned.ac.cr/ecen/) department, where my studies
include, computer science, sociology and others.


Currently working as an IT Specialist at [NI](http://www.ni.com/).

I like to be constanly learning. Since I was a kid my passion is deconstruct and rebuild things from scratch. Usually leaving some screws out. I used to explode dead electronic cards for the mayhem and the toxic smoke they produce, just for the fun of wearing gasmasks.

This blog is a central place for me to publish my ideas on programming, sociology, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy and all
sorts of other things I am interested in and cannot seriously publish elsewhere.
In the very unlikely case that the Internet cares about my personal development, I might post some progress in some projects I am working on.

Among many things I love doing, [I try to bike at least 60km every week](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11810919), and plan to improve as long as time allows it. Follow me on strava. Its very rewarding.
[I also do some 3d printing and robotics as a hobby.]({{site.baseurl}}/3Dprint/)
If ever try doing some sort of art or music again, I might post it. Be afraid.
But also be aware that I procrastinate. This site holds me accountable.
I am also an electrician, a computer technician and builder, I creste industrial automation systems, robotics and I'm very efficient at changing lightbulbs.
