I have recently inmersed in a world that bring new chances to make my imagination fly and make my ideas a real deal.

Back in 2014, I took a debt and about 6 weeks of work to get a Printrbot Simple.
I fine tuned it, calibrated it and made it better. 
So far I have made a few improvements to it.

*	Increased the X axis of the build volume from 100 to 188 mm.
*	Made a filament spool standing above the printer.
*	Installed Raspberry Pi to remotely control and view printings.
*	Changed Extruder nozzle from Ubis Ceramic to Ubis 13s which improved precision and lowered failed prints.
*	Added 80 mm fan to improve print quality.

Many people think it is a waste of money, for me its an amazing learning tool. 
Since I cant really give a shit of naysayers, some planned improments for this machine are:

*	Increase nozzle to hardened steel to handle abrassive materials.
*	Print in Proto-Pasta Carbon Fibre.
*	Add a Bowden extrusion system.
*	Make it double extruder or 4 color extrusion.
*	Make jonhlawrence double precision improvements to X and Y axis.
*	Add a heatbed.
*	Add enclosure.
*	Print in ABS and Nylon CF.
*	Removable laser.
*	Removable mill.

I have dealt with all kinds of issues with this machine, I love to resolve them and se it print at a better quality each time.
I have now the intention to transform a small printrbot in a better machine that allows me to fabricate and prototype better parts at a more efficient rate reducing errors.

At some point I will inmerse myself in 3D Design, once the horse is dominated.

There is also an [active community in Costa Rica ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/649106395172543/)
where all learners of this stuff gather and workship noisy machines like me.

I will keep this page reguraly updated as times allows it but fell free to visit me on other platforms where I upload or fing very cool things to make:

* [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/Padillla)
* [3DHubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/san-jos%C3%A9-costa-rica/hubs/fofo)


Of course I added this page so I can get those improvements become a reality quicker than my paycheck, so if you want a 3D print for your project, personal amusement, or charity, hit that button below and or ping me in [my contact page]({{site.baseurl}}/contact).
